== Changelog ==

TODO do not disconnect sites when the subscription expires, but downgrade them to free instead.
	Increase retry time incrementally by up to one a week?
TODO remove the clearing of options, but default to "free" instead?

TODO for Monitor, when a site isn't registered with us, tell the user about it.
	-> To test, register, then delete from (or modify) DB.
	-> Currently, we send the generic 'failure' response.
		-> We could say the site isn't registered... but wouldn't this open the gate for spammers?
			-> Then again, the service is proxied and requires various secrets to align before responding.

TODO Make "No valid license key was supplied" warning site-wide, instead of only Extension Manager page.

TODO: For Honeypot Timer, add a JS script that updates the timer when the page loads.
	-> If no JS, just keep the server-timer.
	-> If emptied -> fail!
	-> Use the same method PHP uses.

TODO figure out why TSFEM crashes on post-save (keyword email: Andy).

TODO when regaining focus on the post editor, Focus runs all the "45 second" scans at once.
	-> Let's test it at 0.1s and see if it spams and lags out the computer.

TODO when visiting the Extension Manager page, the notice notifyer isn't counted down
	-> Can this even be fixed? Maybe only when counting down to 0.
		-> Though, this issue could actually help users understand that the notifyer badge is for notifications...

TODO update pot file.

TODO test if TSF's installer still works with WP 6.5

TODO convert tsfem.worker to a Map?
	-> It's already quite perfect at the moment, tbf.

= 2.7.0 =

* June TODOth, 2024

**Feature highlights:**

* Honeypot now tests against fast commenters that accelerate time virtually.
* Focus can now make API calls again when creating a new post using the latest Block Editor.

**Detailed log:**

* **The plugin database version is now at `2700`.**
* **Note:** Downgrading to an earlier version of this plugin might cause all extensions to become deactivated.
* **Changed:**
	* We decoupled the active extensions option from the API activation options. This means that extensions will no longer be deactivated after a full disconnect (e.g., after site migration).
	* The update API is now engaged even if WordPress is not checking this specific plugin. We found that users still accidentally downgraded to the WordPress.org version because of Core issues [44118](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44118) and [61055](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/61055).
* **Improved:**
	* We changed the WordPress version compatibility test by using an unmodified variable, instead of one plugins can alter.
* **Removed:**
	* "SEO Trends and Updates" are no longer available. We had different plans for what would've been displayed (i.e., our own news feed), but it devolved into a marketing channel for Google unintentionally.
		* The transient data for this (`tsfem_latest_seo_feed`) will be cleaned up automatically by WordPress.
		* The option `_enable_feed` will disappear when the next API status request is made (or another change is made to the account).
* **Fixed:**
	* Resolved an issue where the plugin updater could cause a fatal error.
	* Resolved an issue where extension post-metadata could be double-unserialized by another plugin or store incoherent data on extraction failure.
	* Resolved an issue where API activation via a constant (`TSF_EXTENSION_MANAGER_API_INFORMATION`) could cause a site to get stuck in instance verification failure. Now, the site disconnects and reconnects automatically.
		* This should happen immediately, but there is a timeout of 3 minutes when this keeps recurring. Then, those who can manage Extension Manager can manually enter "Free" mode.
		* The site will upgrade automatically after 3 minutes, regardless of whether it's was set manually into "Free" mode.
			-> TODO when reconnecting, get_active_extensions() still purports that the extensions are deactivated. Refreshing the page will resolve the issue -- however, this may appear confusing for the user. We should update the cache somehow (this requires a refactor akin to how we handle post/option plugin data in TSF => Make issue)
				-> Or, we could check the order of operation. Manual activation doesn't have this problem.

	-> add a dicitionary service badge.
	-> Make it 2.0.0 if we add the select all button, otherwise 1.6
