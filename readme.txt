**Release date:**

* June TODOth, 2023

**Detailed log:**

* Disconnecting a Premium account when there's an issue with our servers is now possible.
* Installing Extension Manager for the first time will now use option instance verification v3.0, which relies on the site URL instead of plugin folder location (2.0) or salt keys (1.0).
* Constant `TSF_EXTENSION_MANAGER_INSTANCE_VERSION` is now available. This helps users with complex server setups maintain a stable and secure connection by changing to a salt key (1.0), folder location (2.0), or site URL (3.0, the new default).
