**Feature highlights:**

TODO

**Detailed log:**

* Fixed vertical alignment on various elements for Chromium v77. Most prominently affecting Chrome v77+.
* Fixed vertical alignment on select elements for WordPress v5.3. Most prominently affecting, again, Chrome v77+.
* We sacrificed some eye-candy in favor for accessibility and coherency with the updated WordPress v5.3 interface.
* TODO We added the Extension Manager and extension-loader boot-time to the new "HTML boot-time" indicator of The SEO Framework v4.0.
* We removed all archaic browser vendor prefixes from the CSS files, so to reduce the stylesheet payload.
* We repackaged all JS files via Babel, whereras before we used Google's Closure Compiler.
* The SEO Framework v3.3 or later is now required (from v3.1).
* WP v4.9 is now required (from v4.8).
* TODO Local seems to have received a hard pentaly in script-performance since Chrome v77... (hold/type key filling in department name, etc.)... assess why and fix (non-minified is also affected).
* TODO Fixed: Post-Revision metadata can now be processed, just like in TSF v4.0+.

**Updated extensions:**

* TODO Articles
* TODO (script cleanup only) Focus
* TODO (script cleanup only) Monitor

= 2.1.0 - Lucid SEO =

**Release date:**

* August 20th, 2019

**A major release without a new extension:**

* We had [one extension](https://github.com/sybrew/The-SEO-Framework-Extension-Manager/tree/cord-transporter/extensions/free/cord/trunk) planned, but [Site Kit by Google](https://sitekit.withgoogle.com/) is already implementing most of the ideas we had. We're keeping an eye on Google's progression, and we may set up connections via their plugin instead.

**Feature highlights:**

* Support for the upcoming TSF v4.0 release has been added.
* Requests to the new European API are no longer rerouted via our global API.
* Improved performance, especially on IIS-powered servers.
* Several QOL-improvements, like better accessibility, extended API, etc. have been added.

**Updated extensions:**

* [AMP](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/amp/#changelog)
* [Articles](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/articles/#changelog)
* [Local](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/local/#changelog)
