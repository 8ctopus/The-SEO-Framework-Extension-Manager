== Changelog ==

TODO do not disconnect sites when the subscription expires, but downgrade them to free instead.
	Increase retry time incrementally by up to one a week?
	-> do the var_dump() for constant activations
TODO remove the clearing of options, but default to "free" instead?

TODO figure out why iThemes Sync (Solid Central) is loading the admin after is_admin() was false (and then true).
	-> Report it to Brent and them. This is not for us to fix, but iThemes.
		-> Couldn't trace the cause.
		-> Try testing the plugin live.

TODO for Focus, if they set a word with a SPACE, send a notification when a word isn't found: "Check your spelling OR try a single word. Learn more about this [here](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/focus/#faq/are-phrases-supported)."

TODO for Monitor, when a site isn't registered with us, tell the user about it.
	-> To test, register, then delete from (or modify) DB.
	-> Currently, we send the generic 'failure' response.
		-> We could say the site isn't registered... but wouldn't this open the gate for spammers?
			-> Then again, the service is proxied and requires various secrets to align before responding.

TODO Make "No valid license key was supplied" warning site-wide, instead of only Extension Manager page.

TODO: For Honeypot Timer, add a JS script that updates the timer when the page loads.
	-> If no JS, just keep the server-timer.
	-> If emptied -> fail!
	-> Use the same method PHP uses.

TODO figure out why TSFEM crashes on post-save (keyword email: Andy).

TODO do the constant \.

TODO when regaining focus on the post editor, Focus runs all the "45 second" scans at once.
	-> Let's test it at 0.1s and see if it spams and lags out the computer.

TODO trends are displaying escaped HTML.
	-> Just hide the pane until we can do something useful with it?
		-> Remove it altogether. Let's start removing cruft, get it over with.

TODO when visiting the Extension Manager page, the notice notifyer isn't counted down
	-> Can this even be fixed? Maybe only when counting down to 0.
		-> Though, this issue could actually help users understand that the notifyer badge is for notifications...

TODO update pot file.

= 2.7.0 =

* June TODOth, 2024

**Feature highlights:**

* Honeypot now tests against fast commenters that accelerate time.
* Focus can now make API calls again when creating a new post using the latest Block Editor.

**Detailed log:**

* **The plugin database version is now at `2700`.**
* **Note:** Downgrading to an earlier version of this plugin might cause all extensions to become deactivated.
* **Changed:**
	* We decoupled the active extensions option from the API activation options. This means that extensions will no longer be deactivated after a full disconnect (e.g., after site migration).
	* The update API is now engaged even if WordPress is not checking this specific plugin. We found that users still accidentally downgraded to the WordPress.org version because of Core issues [44118](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44118) and [61055](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/61055).
* **Improved:**
	* We changed the WordPress version compatibility test by using an unmodified variable, instead of one plugins can alter.
* **Fixed:**
	* Resolved an issue where the plugin updater could cause a fatal error.
	* Resolved an issue where extension post-metadata could be double-unserialized by another plugin or store incoherent data on extraction failure.
	* Resolved an issue where API activation via a constant (`TSF_EXTENSION_MANAGER_API_INFORMATION`) could cause a site to get stuck in instance verification failure. Now, the site disconnects and reconnects automatically.
		* This should happen immediately, but there is a timeout of 3 minutes when this keeps recurring. Then, those who can manage Extension Manager can manually enter "Free" mode.
		* The site will upgrade automatically after 3 minutes, regardless of whether it's was set manually into "Free" mode.
			-> TODO when reconnecting, get_active_extensions() still purports that the extensions are deactivated. Refreshing the page will resolve the issue -- however, this may appear confusing for the user. We should update the cache somehow (this requires a refactor akin to how we handle post/option plugin data in TSF => Make issue)
				-> Or, we could check the order of operation. Manual activation doesn't have this problem.
