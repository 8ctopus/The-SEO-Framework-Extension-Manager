== Changelog ==

= 2.6.0 =

* Extension Manager now requires PHP 7.3.0 or higher, from PHP 5.6.5.
* The SEO Framework v4.2 or higher is now required, from TSF v4.1.4.
* Touched up the interface, it's now centered, more compact, and easier on the eyes.
* Now relies on The SEO Framework's JavaScript availability test, instead of WordPress's, making unresponsive interfaces less likely when a faulty plugin or theme is installed.
* Modernized PHP code, making the plugin up to 30% faster.
	* TODO test.
* Modernized some JavaScript code, improving UI responsiveness significantly.
* Reduced plugin file size relatively by no longer packing rendered vector images for archaic browser support.
	* TODO Use `<use>` like on TSF site for improved painting performance?
* Introduced a new API alias for `tsf_extension_manager()`: `tsfem()`.
TODO POT file. (also update related github)

* TODO Add index.php files to extension top-folders (and fill in empty index.php files)

* TODO consider cleaning unused functions? e.g. pixels_to_points
* TODO consider removing dependency on /trunk/lib/images/icon.svg and rely on /assets/icon.svg
* TODO use API functions of TSF (memo, has_run, isset()?..: et al.)
* TODO move get_view() to trait, using prescribed base URL.

* TODO instead of "defined( 'TSF_EXTENSION_MANAGER_PRESENT' ) and $_class = TSF_Extension_Manager\Extension\Transport\get_active_class() and ", try a secret (for all extensions).
TODO implement views trait.
TODO remove trends pane... we planned to add our blog items there, but that never came to fruition.
	-> We kept it there to visually balance the page.
		-> Should we let the extensions wrap side-by-side instead? flex base 400px, stretch to fit?
			-> Copy from tsf.fyi/e?
TODO make Traits autoloadable? -> The Construct_* part is annoying -> \Construct\?. Extension_* needs to become \Extension\
	-> `use \TSF_Extension_Manager\Traits\{Construct_Master_Once_Interface,Time,UI,Extension_Options,Extension_Forms,Error};`
TODO use :where() css instead of the avalange of entries.
TODO use `use` for SVG logos? -> Is this feasible? -> tsfem_ui()->register_logo( id, svg );
	-> Don't register logo, just have a symbols output file and use that. At most, tsfem_ui()->output_logo( id, [ 'defaultColor' => false ] );

TODO convert post metadata from double-serialized to single-serialized (with perhaps WP interfering?)
	-> We took control because WP was causing issues with backslashes...

TODO fix notice bounce (reintroduced for we ditched the stagnant :empty selector)
TODO fewer jQuery animations, more CSS animations.
	-> Planned for future update. 3.0?

TODO Reevaluate get_view()'s implicated extract() and the use of get_defined_vars()
	- Neither of these can be populated by the user, still, they are an exploit waiting to happen.

TODO Add "mark as spam, put in trash, or discard/permanently delete the comment."
TODO Add method used to mark as spam as comment-meta? -> Is this possible, I don't want to add more rows.
	-> Otherwise, simply add a counter for each type. Store as array?

TODO When transporter is in session, maybe we can set a flag in the database which is checked every 50 items or something and if it exists, it aborts the current run and "continues (restarts)" on the next one?
	-> Ergo, store 50 (or 250) transactions in memory, when 0==$trans%50, then store blob in database, continue to next 50.
	-> Store end also in database.

TODO "^%sitetitle% %sep%" -> ""?
TODO "%sep% %sitetitle%$" -> ""?

TODO addslashes( serialize( $c_meta ) )  -> $c_meta + maybe_unserialize()?
	-> The maybe_unserialize() will gradually translate metadata back to what it's supposed to be. We can keep this indefinitely, with a NOTE that removing this would incur data loss.
		-> There's no need for a safer maybe_unserialize, for future data won't be serialized, so it at most can be a self-resolving stored issue, not reflective.
	-> Figure out if we can maintain slashes like TSF does by converting them via tsf()->bsol()
		-> Break this feature first by spamming slashes without the serialization feature on a new post.
		-> Then, test if migration is seamless. Test on our own sites, prominently, if the focus keywords stay intact.

= 2.5.0 - Quick SEO =

In this update, we added quick-and bulk-edit support, improved browser scripting performance, and improved various extensions. Most notably, Honeypot catches modernized spammers, Articles can now be disabled per-post, and Focus's API is vastly expanded.

* Henceforth, Extension Manager requires **The SEO Framework v4.1.2 or higher**.
* This release brings support for WordPress v5.6's updated interface. Sorry for the delay!

Please manually moderate your comment section for a few minutes after updating, and be sure to clear your site's caches directly after updating to reduce the number of false negatives significantly.
