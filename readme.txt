Add more powerful SEO features to The SEO Framework right from your WordPress dashboard. No sign-up required.

== Description ==

**This plugin extends [The SEO Framework](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/).**

This plugin adds an extra dashboard menu entry, in which you can activate the latest free and premium extensions.

= Current Extensions =

* **AMP:** It binds The SEO Framework to the [AMP plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/) for [AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/) supported articles and pages.
* **Articles:** It enhances your published posts by automatically adding [both AMP and non-AMP Structured Data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/articles), which makes your posts legible for various Search Engine usages.
* **Monitor:** It keeps track of your website's SEO, optimization, uptime and statistics. It's still an experimental extension, but a lot is planned for it.
* **Incognito:** It removes all front-end branding from The SEO Framework, like HTML comments.
* **Title Fix:** It makes sure your title output is as configured. Even if your theme is doing it wrong.
* **Honeypot:** It catches comment spammers in four lightweight yet powerful ways.

= Upcoming Extension =

This following extension is planned for the next major versions.

* **Transporter:** It allows you to export and import your SEO settings from site to site.
* **Local SEO:** When configured, it tells Search Engines about the physical location of your business.

= Requirements: =
TODO move this to Installation (see https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/#installation for a great example).
* For security and structural reasons, this plugin requires **PHP 5.5 or later** and **WordPress 4.4 or later**, or it will deactivate itself.
* This plugin requires **The SEO Framework 2.7.0 or later** to be active, or it won't do anything at all.
* For improved performance, your PHP handler should use a 64 bits architecture, because it uses large primes for security.
* Internet Explorer 11 or later. For best experience use a Webkit, EdgeHTML, Gecko or Blink based browser.

> <strong>The premium software is Open Source:</strong><br>
> This plugin and all extensions within are open source. This means they can be easily altered and shared.<br>
> If you've acquired extensions for The SEO Framework from outside your WordPress Dashboard or WordPress.org, they could contain malware.
>
> This also accounts for any other premium software acquired for free. Please, be careful.

= About Premium =

A premium subscription will allow you to activate all premium extensions for one single subscription price.

Some premium extensions can communicate with The SEO Framework's API server to provide extra functionality. This added functionality is optional and its usage differs per extension.

As long as the subscription is active, you're allowed to use all premium extensions. When the subscription expires or is deactivated, the premium extensions will no longer be accessible.

= Privacy =
TODO move this to Installation
* This plugin can send API requests to "https://premium.theseoframework.com/" and our other sites.
* Read our [privacy policy](https://theseoframework.com/privacy/).
* Questions about privacy? Feel free to (contact us)[https://theseoframework.com/contact/].

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is this? =
The Extension Manager for The SEO Framework allows you to enable various extensions to enhance your experience and improve your SEO.

= What is The SEO Framework? =
A free SEO plugin, for everyone! Download it [from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/).

= What is an Extensions? =
An Extension is like a plugin, and can be activated and deactivated on demand. All available extensions, both free and premium, are included in this plugin package.

= Do I need to activate all extensions? =
No. The extensions are tailored for very specific types of websites. Incorrect usage of certain extensions could even harm your website's SERP rankings.
Each extension will include carefully crafted documentation in the near future.

= Do I need to register an account? =
Not at all! This extension manager provides up to date free extensions, without requiring an API connection.

= Are there advertisements? =
Nope. This plugin only shows which extensions are available on the activation page. It will show both free and premium ones.
Some buttons, like on the extension activation page, can lead you to the site where you can purchase a license, but only if you choose to do so.

= Does this plugin track my usage? =
Absolutely not! This plugin does not include any user tracking software. We completely rely on your feedback to know what you require.

= What's the release cycle of extensions? =
Every y.X update (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.) will include a new extension. Every y.y.X update (1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc.) fixes bugs and/or adds new functionality to existing extensions.
No X.y updates (2.0, 3.0, etc.) are planned as of now. We plan to release a new extension every (other) month.

= I've received an error code, what now? =
Follow the steps provided next to the error code, if any. If the error keeps coming back, let us know through on the support forums.
Note that Premium Extensions aren't supported within the WordPress.org support forums; you'll have to [contact us directly](https://theseoframework.com/contact/).

= Which users can activate extensions? =
Only users who can manage options are allowed to interact with this plugin.

= Where are the extensions acquired from? =
Both free and premium extensions are provided within the plugin package acquired from WordPress.org.

= Does the Extension Manager need to stay activated in order to run the extensions? =
Yes. The Extension Manager supplies its own extension activation management system apart from WordPress'.
Deactivating the Extension Manager will also deactivate all extensions.

= When my subscription expires, what happens? =
When your premium subscription expires, the premium extensions will automatically deactivate.
A margin of error is allowed, so you don't have to worry for if the activation server is down.

= I want to modify an extension, is this allowed? =
Of course! This plugin is licensed with GPLv3, after all. However, please note that the plugin checks for file changes and compares hashes to prevent rogue software penetration.
After all, this plugin can connect with our API server and we don't want third party plugins to interfere in any way.

= Does this plugin work on MultiSite Networks? =
Yes. This plugin can be network activated while The SEO Framework base plugin is activated site by site without issues.
Alternatively, this plugin can be activated per site while The SEO Framework is network activated. Any other combination is possible too.

= Are there WordPress MultiSite network specific SEO extensions? =
They're planned! Unfortunately, there's still a lot to be done before this is even possible.

= What happens when I deactivate my account? =
All plugin settings will be deleted, this includes which extensions were enabled.
Each extension handles its own options (if any); those settings won't be lost, not even upon re-activation of the extension at a later time.

= Does my website support this plugin? =
If it doesn't, it will tell you why. Otherwise, you're good to go! All known issues are correctly labeled with an identification number.
If you were to get a plugin activation error, either open a support ticket [here](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/the-seo-framework-extension-manager) or contact your host and ask them to upgrade PHP to a stable and secure version.

= The layout of the plugin pages just doesn't look right, why? =
This plugin has been tested against many browsers with the help of [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/), we support the latest and most popular browsers, even Internet Explorer!
However, because the plugin pages have been completely written in [state-of-the-art experimental CSS flexbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/), it's possible not all browsers act alike.
Although everything should always fit perfectly; if you do find any issue, please state your browser and operating system and tell us where the issue resides. Thanks!

== Changelog ==

= 1.2.0 - Aptitudinal SEO =

* **Release date:**
	* May 15th, 2017

**New Extension:**

* **Honeypot**: This catches comment spammers in four lightweight yet powerful ways.

**Detailed log:**

**Plugin Improvements:**

* **Local:**
	* Performance: Instance verification key options are now correctly deleted upon account deactivation.
	* Performance: Error notice option is now no longer deleted on sight, preventing incremental option ID polution.
	* Performance: Error notice option is now no longer autoloaded when unset.
	* Performance: Trends Feed's links no longer bind to your browser's used threads when followed. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/noopener).
	* Improvement: Added useful AJAX error reporting, like for when timeouts happen.
	* Improvement: Buttons' texts are now more readable across different browsers.
	* Change: The SEO Extensions menu item now is visible for users with the `manage_options` capability, rather than either of `install_plugins` or `activate_plugins`.
	* Fixed: The extension list now also renders correctly on Safari 9 (next fix is unrelated, but had exactly the same impact).
	* Fixed: Safari 6, 7 and 8 now show all extension; which is more than [two-thirds](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=136041).
	* Fixed: Extension activation tester now tests JSON test file for errors too.
	* Fixed: In a very unlikely event, a fatal error could be produced on either the front-end or back-end (on average once every 2,984,876,523 requests as of Unix Timestamp 1492438262).
	* Fixed: Theoretically, this plugin will now work after December 31st, 2037 on 32 bits PHP handlers.
	* Fixed: Browser memory leak through tooltips on (de)activation of extensions.
	* Change: The tooltip is now a shade of black, rather than an off-color of ocean blue.
	* Change: The internal hashing algorithm has been expanded.
		* Unless a server administrator has destructively modified PHP's source files, this shouldn't have any effect.
		* If your server supports sha1, but not sha256, you might get error 2001.
		* To resolve error 2001, take note of your active extensions, deactivate your account and set up the plugin again.
			* No useful data is lost in this process. But so far, no useful data is held either; only renewable caches.

* **API:**
	* **Internal:**
		* When trying to activate an expired subcription, it will now tell the correct error.
			* The error code has been changed from 7009 to 308, because it tried to allow a margin of error incorrectly.
	* **External:**
		* May 9th, 2017: Cancelled subscriptions now pass the end-date too.

**Extension Improvements:**

* **Free - AMP:**
	* **Version:**
		* 1.0.1
	* **Added:**
		* Indicators of where TSF output starts and ends when using TSF 2.9.2 or later.
* **Premium - Articles:**
	* **Version:**
		* 1.0.0-gamma-2
	* **Premium only until gamma-testing is completed.**
	* **Changed:**
		* The automated description is now set to 155 characters, rather than 400.
			* Evidently, it uses the same restrictions as regular search results.
	* **Fixed:**
		* No more PHP notice should be output when fetching image from SEO settings.
		* Social image from SEO settings now works if set, but only if TSF 2.9+ is active.
			* Otherwise the Featured Image is used, if any.
		* It no longer outputs Schema.org metadata on WooCommerce products or other single custom post types.
			* Instead, it only outputs on WordPress' Posts.
* **Premium - Monitor:**
	* **Version:**
		* 1.0.0-beta-3
	* **Internal:**
		* **Changed:**
			* The Monitor menu item now is visible for users with the `manage_options` capability, rather than `install_plugins`.
		* **Fixed:**
			* More agressive buffer cleaning has been put in place to prevent failing AJAX requests.
			* The SEO Framework's internal debugging methods can no longer interfere with the output.
			* Server and Browser AJAX errors can now resolve when requesting updates.
			* Server and Browser AJAX errors can now resolve when requesting crawl.
	* **API:**
		* **Note:** These API changes affect only this plugin version.
			* **Added:**
				* The crawler now tests for Scheme settings. It checks for HTTPS headers and the related canonical URL output.
					* Also vice versa, so if your site isn't accessible on HTTPS, but your canonical URL states it is, it will warn you.
		* **Note:** These API changes affect all plugin versions.
			* **Added:**
				* May 7th, 2017: Only the root file is now checked, rather than subdirectories.
				* May 14th, 2017: It now confirms if your website is accessible on HTTPS.
				* May 14th, 2017: It now checks canonical URLs for scheme issues.
			* **Fixed:**
				* March 18th, 2017: When your site embeds external services like YouTube, the crawler no longer crashes.
				* April 1st, 2017: When your metadata favicon isn't output by WordPress, it can now also be detected.
				* **A better foundation:**
					* May 14th, 2017: Alternative output of the metadata favicon tag's closing tag can now be detected too.
					* May 14th, 2017: Compressed pages can now also be correctly tested for favicons.
					* May 14th, 2017: Single quotes' favicons metadata can now also be detected.
* **Premium - Honeypot:**
	* **Version:**
		* 1.0.0-beta
	* **This is a new extension**.
	* It uses four powerful and lightweight techniques to stop comment spamming:
		1. A rotating by ID input field, hidden through rotating CSS.
			* This field must stay empty.
			* This requires the spammer to enable styling.
			* This field is rotated per post.
		1. A rotating by time input field, hidden through rotating CSS.
			* This field must stay empty.
			* This requires the spammer to enable styling.
			* A new key is generated every hour and for every post.
			* After two hours of waiting, this field has no positive or negative effect.
			* It acts as the first method when using cache.
		1. A rotating by time input field that must be emptied, hidden and automatically emptied through rotating JavaScript.
			* This field must become empty.
			* This requires the spammer to enable scripts.
			* If scripts are disabled, the user needs to manually clear the field.
				* A helpful message is displayed that clearly indicates it's an anti-spam technique.
				* That message is translatable; in the future options will be added so you can manually adjust these fields.
			* This always works with caching and is proven to be the most effective method with 99,99% catch rate over 1500 comments in 1 month.
		1. A rotating by time nonce field, that must be identical to the expected value.
			* This field must have an expected value.
			* This prevents spammers using PHP files to comment; instead, the must view and render your comment forms.
			* The nonce key is different for each post and is time-attack secure.
			* The nonce key changes every 12 hours. Each key is valid for 24 hours.
				* When using caching, the nonce key changes every 5 days. Each key is valid for 10 days.
	* It works by using expected hashing algorithms. So it doesn't make use of the database. Therefore, it's extremely lightweight.
	* It works wherever WordPress' comments are used, also on WooCommerce reviews.
	* It works only when users are logged out. Users who are logged in aren't checked.
	* It works with caching, then being less agressive.
* **Free - Transporter:**
	* **Version:**
		* 1.0.0-dev2017-05-15
	* **This extension is not accessible at the moment, because it's still in development.**

= 1.0.0 - Amplified SEO =

* **Release date:**
	* January 1st, 2017

**Changelog:**

* Initial public release.

== Upgrade Notice ==

== Other Notes ==
TODO move this to development/installation?

= Are you a developer? =
And do you wish to add your own extension to the extension manager? Please contact me on [Slack](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/@cybr/) about your idea.
A full code review will take place prior to releasing it. The code has to pass at least all of the WordPress.org plugin standards and all code must be licensed under GPLv3.
Feedback and points for improvement will be always given. No monetized nor premium extensions are being accepted as of yet. API connections aren't allowed either.

= For developers: Security =
Because this plugin handles multiple input fields, multiple nonce fields had to be created in order to prevent XSS from otherwise unauthorized users.
In order to minimize overhead, each nonce type has been supplied an action. This way, the validation all falls under one function.
Many more security techniques, some unprecedented in open source, have been implemented into this plugin.
If you have any questions, before blindly implementing or circumvent security, feel free to contact me (the plugin author) on [Slack](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/@cybr/).

= Reluctance towards plugin modifications and backwards compatibility =
This plugin should be compatible with any other plugin or theme (unless they cause PHP errors on their own).
You are allowed to edit this plugin and use hooks on this plugin (as per GPLv3), but any external or internal modification can stop working on any update without prior notice.
This is to enhance the plugin security, stability and overall performance. Please note that most core functions, classes, methods and files are shielded against both direct and indirect calls.
No backwards compatibility will be programmed into this plugin, unless required for WordPress Core or PHP.
