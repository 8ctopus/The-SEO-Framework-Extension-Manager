== Changelog ==

TODO add RTL support for _print_tsf_nag_installer_styles (regression)
TODO fix tsf dependency in _check_external_blocking
TODO align AMP's get_social_metadata() with TSF's output handling? This might incur deprecation of some filters.
TODO `tsfem_error_notice_option` -> `tsfem_error_notices`
TODO `tsf-extension-manager-settings` -> `tsfem_settings`?
TODO https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/590 (add three fields: Valuta, Min price, Max price; and/or a dropdown: "Cheap/OK/Expensive/Exclusive" (find proper terms)).
TODO https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/616

TODO Convert tsfem-ui/tsfem-inpost notice handler into separate class?
	-> The one from tsfem-inpost is more advanced, allowing separate notice wraps.

TODO add save all button. -> Basically run through all forms and save them, and send message from "saved for one extension" to "saved for X (slug)."

* **Changed:** Reduced the likelihood of random disconnects caused by iThemes Security's nonsensical option to flush security keys every two weeks. New sites no longer rely on these proper authentication keys for hashing, but now use a combination of environmental variables, like the database version and the installation location. Change any of these, and your site could disconnect from our services. You can reconnect after disconnecting without losing data. This check performs entirely locally.
* **Improved:** Increased clarity about how the API connection is validated.
* **Improved:** Notification animations are faster now, and no longer cause minor text movement.
* **Improved:** Optimized option handling for improved performance.
* **Updated:** Now uses our licensing API v2.2, primarily for key naming convenience.
* **Other:** Modernized code.
* **Other:** New translations are available. TODO update POT

* [AMP at version 1.2.1](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/monitor/#changelog)
