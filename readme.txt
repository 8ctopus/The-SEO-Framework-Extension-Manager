== Frequently Asked Questions ==

TODO check again.

= What is this? =
This free extension is made because many themes are rendering the title wrong. This causes issues, which this plugin resolves.

= What is The SEO Framework? =
A free SEO plugin, for everyone! Download it [from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/)

= Do I require an account? =
Not at all! This extension manager provides up to date free extensions.

= Are there advertisements? =
Not thoughout the dashboard. This plugin only shows which extensions are available on the activation page. It will show both free and premium ones.
The activation page will lead you through the site where you can purchase a license, but only if you choose to do so.

= Which users can activate extensions? =
Only users who can install and activate plugins are allowed to view and notice the presence of this plugin.

= Where are the plugins acquired from? =
The plugins are provided through a secure gateway to any authorized plugin user.

= Does the Extension Manager need to stay activated in order to run the plugins? =
Yes. The Extension Manager supplies its own plugin activation management system apart from the WordPress core one.

= Are there MultiSite network SEO plugins? =
They're planned! This plugin requires a separate network license in order to run them.

= If I'm using a MultiSite network, do I need to activate the plugins site by site? =
You're able to choose. In network mode, only the super admin can download extensions. Only the downloaded extensions will be shown within the sub-site activation page.
Only admin users of those sites can activate the plugins, and only when the Plugins menu is active, see [filters](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/other_notes/) for expanded options.

= Does my website support this plugin? =
If it doesn't, it will tell you why. Otherwise, you're good to go!
If you were to get an activation error, either open a support ticket [here](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/the-seo-framework-extension-manager) or contact your host and ask them to upgrade PHP to a stable version.
