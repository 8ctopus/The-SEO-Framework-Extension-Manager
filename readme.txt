= 2.7.0 - Sane SEO =

**Release date:**

* November 19th, 2024

**Feature highlights:**

* Honeypot now tests against fast commenters that accelerate time virtually.
* Focus can now make API calls again when creating a new post using the latest Block Editor.
* We spent the past year optimizing this plugin, resolving annoyances and making the plugin almost twice as fast.

**Detailed log:**

* **The plugin database version is now at `2700`.**
* **Note:** Downgrading to an earlier version of this plugin might cause all extensions to become deactivated.
* **Changed:**
	* We decoupled the active extensions option from the API activation options. This means that extensions will no longer be deactivated after a full disconnect (e.g., after site migration).
	* The update API now engages even if WordPress is not checking this specific plugin. We found that users still accidentally downgraded to the WordPress.org version because of Core issues [44118](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44118) and [61055](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/61055).
	* When your subscription expires or is pending, you no longer need to reconnect manually, but there's now a grace period of 7 days for Extension Manager to reconnect automatically.
		* Once this grace period is passed, your account will need to be upgraded manually again.
		* Automatic reconnecting is tried every 2 minutes.
		* You are also offered to manually switch the license key during this grace period.
	* We've updated the color scheme slightly to be more aligned with modern WordPress and The SEO Framework v5.1.
* **Improved:**
	* We changed the WordPress version compatibility test by using an unmodified variable, instead of one plugins can alter.
	* We modernized critical JavaScript code, slightly improving browser interaction performance.
	* We modernized some CSS code, slightly reducing the plugin file sizes.
	* We modernized some PHP code, slightly improving server response times.
	* We changed the load sequence of the plugin to remove action overhead. It now loads at `init`, instead of `plugins_loaded`.
		* Simultaneously, it resolves a deprecation notice with WordPress 6.7, which may be [reverted in 6.7.1](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/62462).
	* Added PHP 8.4 OPcache optimizations.
* **Removed:**
	* "SEO Trends and Updates" are no longer available. We had different plans for what would've been displayed (i.e., our own news feed), but it devolved into a marketing channel for Google unintentionally.
		* The transient data for this (`tsfem_latest_seo_feed`) will be cleaned up automatically by WordPress.
		* The option `_enable_feed` will disappear when the next API status request is made (or another change is made to the account).
* **Fixed:**
	* Resolved an issue where the plugin updater could cause a fatal error.
	* Resolved an issue where extension post-metadata could be double-unserialized by another plugin or store incoherent data on extraction failure.
	* Resolved an issue where API activation via a constant (`TSF_EXTENSION_MANAGER_API_INFORMATION`) could cause a site to get stuck in instance verification failure. Now, the site disconnects and reconnects automatically.
		* This should happen immediately, but there is a timeout of 3 minutes when this keeps recurring. Then, those who can manage Extension Manager can manually enter "Free" mode.
		* The site will upgrade automatically after 3 minutes, regardless of whether it's was set manually into "Free" mode.
* **Other:**
	* Another year has turned. So, we updated all files' copyright coverage.
	* New translations are available.
