== Changelog ==

= 2.4.1 =

* **Added:** This plugin now supports The SEO Framework's 4.0.5+ quick-and bulk-edit functionality for its extensions.
* **Improved:** TODO Akin to TSF v4.1.1, we also dropped most jQuery calls in this plugin, greatly improving the UI's responsiveness in the administrative dashboards.
* **Fixed:** Resolved a race condition with the AJAX loader notifications.
* **Fixed:** Resolved an issue where multiple non-unique identifiers for no-JS-submit-buttons were used on the Extension Manager overview page.
* **Fixed:** Resolved an issue where quotes in metadata could cause serialization issues.
* **Dev:** Constant `TSF_EXTENSION_MANAGER_PRESENT` is now available. It indicates that the plugin is activated by WordPress, but it does not necessarily indicate that it's running otherwise.
* **Other:** The SEO Framework 4.0.5 or higher is now required, from 4.0.0.
* **Other:** WordPress 5.1 or higher is now required, from 4.9.
* **Other:** We now enforce [TSF coding standards](https://github.com/theseoframework/wpcs-tsf) for opcode performance, intercompatibility, and reliability.
* **Other:** TODO This plugin is now compatible with PHP 8.0-RC1. This ensures compatibility with PHP 8.0 when it releases to the public, but changes may be provisionary.

= 2.4.0 - Linguistic SEO =

**Release date:**

* June 2nd, 2020

**Feature highlights:**

* In this update, we reduced the plugin package size by 30%. Thanks to offloading translation files elsewhere on our servers, this reduction saves you bandwidth and speeds up plugin installation.
* During Extension Manager plugin update requests, your WordPress website may now download new and updated translation files independently. Which files are requested is based on your site's supported languages.
* We upgraded the extension API endpoint, which allows for reverse inflection lookups via the Focus extension, for 7 languages!
* We removed a filter that directed admin access control. We found that it wasn't secure enough (by our insane standards); so, use the new constant definition, instead. With that constant, you can now (finally) independently control extension-settings from manager access.

**Updated extensions:**

* [Articles at version 2.0.4](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/articles/#changelog)
* [Focus at version 1.4.0](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/focus/#changelog)
* [Local at version 1.1.7](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/local/#changelog)
* [Monitor at version 1.2.6](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/monitor/#changelog)
