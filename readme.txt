= 2.4.0 - Linguistic SEO =

**Release date:**

* June 2nd, 2020

**Feature highlights:**

* In this update, we reduced the plugin package size by 30%. Thanks to offloading translation files elsewhere on our servers, this reduction saves you bandwidth and speeds up plugin installation.
* During Extension Manager plugin update requests, your WordPress website may now download new and updated translation files independently. Which files are requested is based on your site's supported languages.
* We upgraded the extension API endpoint, which allows for reverse inflection lookups via the Focus extension, for 7 languages!
* We removed a filter that directed admin access control. We found that it wasn't secure enough (by our insane standards); so, use the new constant definition, instead. With that constant, you can now (finally) independently control extension-settings from manager access.

**Updated extensions:**

* [Articles at version 2.0.4](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/articles/#changelog)
* [Focus at version 1.4.0](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/focus/#changelog)
* [Local at version 1.1.7](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/local/#changelog)
* [Monitor at version 1.2.6](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/monitor/#changelog)
